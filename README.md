# Competition Notebooks Repository

Welcome to my repository of competition notebooks! This collection represents my journey through various data science and machine learning competitions, primarily focusing on challenges from platforms like Kaggle. Here, I share my approaches, solutions, and insights gained from participating in these competitions.
